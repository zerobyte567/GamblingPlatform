# Voodoo Token Gambling Platform  

The gambling platform allows users to gamble with **Voodoo Token (VDO)**, **MAGIC Reward Token (MAGIC)**, or the **POISON Reward Token (POISON)** in a fully decentralized environment, combining entertainment with Web3 utility.  

## Overview  

The Voodoo Token Gambling Platform is a decentralized application (DApp) offering a classic Coinflip game where users bet on heads or tails. Built on PulseChain, it ensures fast transactions, minimal fees ($0.02 per transaction), and no third-party interference. Players can win up to 300% returns using multiplier options, with outcomes determined by a smart contract.

## Key Features  

- **Decentralized Coinflip:** Play directly against the smart contract with no intermediaries.
- **Multi-Token Support:** Gamble with **VDO**, **MAGIC**, or **POISON** tokens.

- **Multiplier Options:**  
  | Multiplier | Payout | Win Chance |  
  |------------|--------|------------|  
  | x2         | 100%   | 48%        |  
  | x3         | 200%   | 25%        |  
  | x4         | 300%   | 12.5%      |
  
- **Low Fees:** PulseChain’s gas fees average **$0.02 per transaction**.  
- **Transparent Outcomes:** All results are verifiable on the PulseChain blockchain explorer.  

## How It Works  

1. **Connect Wallet:** Use MetaMask or a PulseChain-compatible wallet.  
2. **Select Token:** Choose VDO, MAGIC, or POISON.  
3. **Set Bet Amount:** Enter the amount you wish to gamble.  
4. **Choose Multiplier:** Option for higher rewards with lower win change or vice versa.  
5. **Heads/Tails:** Pick your side and confirm the transaction.  
6. **Confirm & Play:** Approve the bet in your wallet and await the result. 

Winnings are instantly credited to your wallet, while losses fund the smart contract for future players.

## Security & Transparency
